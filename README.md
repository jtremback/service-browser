This is a web app for browsing services available on the [People's Open Network](https://peoplesopen.net/).

It is a simple node.js/express based web app that uses mDNS/DNS-SD to listen for services and informs the web clients about them using websockets.

For testing purposes, check out [Simple Service Advertisement](https://github.com/sudomesh/simple-service-advertisement) to advertise local services in order to see the browser in use.

# Download #

```
git clone https://github.com/sudomesh/service-browser.git
```

# Install dependencies #

```
sudo apt-get install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev
cd service-browser/
npm install
```

# Build #

```
npm build
```

# Setup #

Specify the port and hostname where you want the server to listen in config.js.

# Running #

```
npm start
```

The service browser will be available at:
```
http://HOST:PORT/static
```
where HOST and PORT are defined in config.js

# Test #

```
npm test
```

# DB Scripts #

Available db = [development, test]

Dump DB to console.
```
node db/db_tasks.js <db> dump
```

Seed DB with services.
```
node db/db_tasks.js <db> seed
```

Drop all records.
```
node db/db_tasks.js <db> clear
```


# Gulp/Browserify/Bower #

service-browser uses Gulp, Browserify, and Bower to manage front-end dependencies.
So this means that you can use npm packages inside of client-side javascript
There's pretty decent documentation for these modules all over the internets.

## Gulp ##

Gulp is a javascript build system/task manager. By running `./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js` you are 
running the `./gulp/tasks/default.js` task which runs a build and then watch task.
The build task will optimize images, compile LESS and run browserify.

All of the tasks are under  `./gulp/tasks`. You can run any individual tasks by running:
`./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js build` where build is the name of the task you'd want to run


## Browserify ##

Browserify is a nifty tool which lets you use CommonJS require syntax to pull in npm modules into
client-side JS. Thanks substack!
Most of the magic is inside of `./gulp/tasks/browserify.js`

Say you wanted to use lodash (an underscore analog) in a client-side script. You could do the following
`npm install --save lodash` (use --save if you want to add the module to package.json)
Then inside your client-side JS, you could do the following:

````
var _ = require('lodash')
console.log(_)
```

We also make pretty significant use of browserify-shim, which lets us include packages that aren't 
installable via npm. This is mostly setup inside of `./package.json`. The relevant passage looks 
similar to:

```
  "browser": {
    "jquery-cookie": "./www/bower_components/jquery.cookie/jquery.cookie.js",
    "sockjs-client": "./www/bower_components/sockjs/sockjs.js"
  },
  "browserify": {
    "transform": [
      "browserify-shim",
      "hbsfy"
    ]
  },
  "browserify-shim": {
    "jquery-cookie": {
      "depends": [
        "jquery:$"
      ],
      "exports": "jquery.cookie"
    },
    "sockjs-client": {
      "exports": "SockJS"
    }
  }
```
The values of "browser" are key value pairs where the key is the require() name and the value
is the location of the package

"browserify-shim" delineates the specifics of each of the shimmed packages. There is a field 
for what the package depends on and what it exports. That would be the result of the assignment
```
var variable = require('sockjs-client')
```

The location of the package can be anywhere, although I've been mostly using bower to install
3rd party packages, which brings us to....


## Bower ##
Bower is a fairly generic and unopinionated front-end package manager. I've been using it to install
anything that doesn't exist in npm as well as css packages (like bootstrap)

To install a new package, cd into ./www and then run
```
../node_modules/bin/bower install --save bootstrap
```
where bootstrap is the package you want to install and --save saves it to bower.json

There are a variety of ways you can now use these packages:

- browserify-shim: see above 
- less/css: inside of `./www/css/imports.less` you'll see the lines:
```
  @import "../bower_components/bootstrap/less/bootstrap.less";
```
That will import the bootstrap less file, which will then be compiled by browserify, etc. 


# Troubleshooting #

If you get an error like this:

```
Module version mismatch, refusing to load
```

Then ensure that you don't have any older versions of node, node-gyp or npm sitting around. Deleting older versions of node-gyp from ~/.node-gyp/ may fix this problem.

If you get an error like this:

```
../src/mdns.hpp:31:20: fatal error: dns_sd.h: No such file or directory
 #include <dns_sd.h>
                    ^
compilation terminated.

gyp ERR! node -v v0.10.26

```
it looks like it can be fixed by installing libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev
```
sudo apt-get install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev
```

```
#!/bin/bash
#On Ubuntu Saucy:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python2.6
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2.6 20
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2.7 10

#you can switch between 2.6 & 2.7 using:
sudo update-alternatives --config python
```

It looks like python 2.6 might be a dependency for the mdns module, in which case the stack overflow answer allows for easy switching between 2.6 and 2.7

# ToDo #

* Currently only lists http/https services
* Searching services
* Organizing by category/etc.
* On service down, remember the service but flag it as down and filter when pushing to clients.
* Implement levedb on client and sync with on connect.
* Save up/down votes from client.
